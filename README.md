# H1-Fitness

This react app is a clone of the workout tracker app <a href="https://www.hevyapp.com/" target="_blank">HEVY</a>.

The goal of this app is to enter exercise routines with sets, reps, and weights. Routines can then be started, and sets be marked as completed. This project is not completed and has no single social aspects at this time. There are major features that are missing at this time.

The UI is inspired by the actual <a href="https://www.hevyapp.com/" target="_blank">HEVY</a> app and this project is just practice.
